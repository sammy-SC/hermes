Make sure that you know exactly what kind of\ntransformation you are doing and why. Canonicalizations are transformations that\nexpose opportunities for other transformations.  Re-association (reducing tree\nheight, placing constants on the RHS, etc.) is a canonicalization because it\norganizes things in predictable patterns and makes the life of future\noptimizations simpler by reducing the number of possible inputs. Inlining is\nanother example of effective canonicalization because it exposes opportunities\nfor optimizations in the caller function (by providing more information).\nAnother example is loop rotation, which is a canonical representation of all\nloops.  In canonicalization we strive to clean up the program as much as\npossible and reach a pure representation of the program.  Simplification is what\nwe normally think of as optimizations, like removing redundancy by deleting dead\ncode and optimizing arithmetic, etc.  Canonicalization can allow simplification\nthat can allow more canonicalization.  For example, de-virtualization unblocks\ninlining that may allow some transformations that enable more de-virtualization.\nLowering transformations are the opposite of canonicalization. In Lowering\ntransformations we generate patterns that are closer to the target\nrepresentation. We may not be able to recover from lowering transformations. One\nexample for lowering transformation is loop strength reduction where the\noptimizer transforms loop indices into non-consecutive accesses that fit with\nthe hardware instruction set. Another example is loop versioning where the body\nof the loop is duplicated and versioned multiple times ."))))}h.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
